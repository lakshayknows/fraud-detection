# Fraud Detection Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning models. The dataset consists of financial transaction records labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost, have been implemented and evaluated.

## Dataset
Due to its large size, the dataset has not been uploaded to GitHub. However, it is available on Kaggle:
[Kaggle Dataset - Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshaykahai/fraud-detection)

## Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and inconsistent data.
- **Encoding:** Converted categorical variables into numerical form.
- **Scaling:** Standardized numerical features using MinMaxScaler.
- **Splitting:** Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Models Used
The following models were trained and evaluated:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**

## Results
| Model                 | Accuracy  |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 0.9987    |
| Decision Tree       | 0.9995    |
| XGBoost            | 0.9995    |

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Place it in the project directory.
3. Run `internship.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
